My current research is on avalanches and how to detect them from space and with lidar data. While, my PhD was in glaciology were I developed numerical models of the Greenland ice sheet and studied black carbon and albedo. Overall I am interested in data analytics and increasing research quality by automating the mundane tasks wherever possible. For this I like to dive deep into interesting technology such as docker, streamlit, dask, FastAPI and of course machine learning.


I co-founded and sold [a guiding company](http://fatbikespitsbergen.com) in the northernmost town at [78 degrees north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen). Currently, I am also a co-founder at ATSEDA AB - a data science company in Sweden.

I speak German, English, Swedish and a bit of Norwegian, so you can contact me in any of these languages, but preferably in German or English.
