title: "Integrated Avalanche Monitoring Based on Satellite Data for Austria"

event: 6. Internationales Lawinensymposium
event_url: https://lawinensymposium.naturfreunde.at

location: Arbeiterkammersaal Graz
address:
  city: Graz
  country: Austria

summary: RSnowAUT Consortium presentation on satellite-based integrated avalanche monitoring for Austria.
abstract: |
  The RSnowAUT (Remote Sensing of Snow in Austria) project develops an integrated avalanche monitoring system based on satellite remote sensing data for Austria. The presentation covers the methodology, data sources, and applications of satellite-derived snow and avalanche monitoring across Austrian alpine regions. This approach enables large-scale, cost-effective monitoring to support avalanche forecasting services and enhance safety measures in mountainous areas. The project represents a collaboration of multiple Austrian research institutions and operational services working together to advance avalanche monitoring capabilities through modern Earth observation technology.
