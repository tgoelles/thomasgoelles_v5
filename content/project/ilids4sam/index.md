iLIDS4SAM is a flagship project for Austria´s future in automated mobility.  Automated mobility systems are presently moving towards more complex urban traffic scenarios. The FFG-funded iLIDS4SAM project will enable this transition by developing high performance, low-cost LiDAR sensors with increased field of view and resolution.
