abstract: 'The perception supply chain (SC1) of the ArchitectECA2030 project investigates
  failure modes, fault detection, and residual risk in perception systems of electrified,
  connected, and automated (ECA) vehicles. This accounts for the needs of a reliable
  understanding of the surrounding environment. The three demonstrators of SC1, described
  in this paper, address steps of a typical ECA usage cycle: charge - drive - restart
  charging. The foreign object detection (FOD) demonstrator improves safety within
  a wireless charging system. The robust physical sensors demonstrator creates a more
  robust perception by detecting failures within fused and single sensor data. The
  position enhancement demonstrator improves vehicle localization in areas with reduced
  GNSS signal coverage. All demonstrators are linked to the challenges that occur
  during the ECA vehicle usage cycle'
